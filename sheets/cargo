# Cargo is the Rust package manager
# Cargo downloads your Rust project's dependencies,
# compiles your project, makes packages, and upload them to crates.io

cargo new hello_world --bin     # program
cargo new hello_world --lib     # library

# Build a project
cargo build

# Build a project with optimizations turned on
cargo build --release

# Updates dependencies in Cargo.lock
cargo update            # update all
cargo update -p rand    # updates just “rand”

# run the project tests (from src/ and tests/)
cargo test

# search for a package
