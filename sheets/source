# This is a shell built-in available in Bash, but not in the Bourne Shell
# (`sh`). The contents of FILE (assuming shell script) will be sourced into the
# current session, allowing external use of its functions, variables, etc.
source FILE
# The above can be written in short-hand, for the same effect:
. FILE
